**Modeling problem report**

Every student will be assigned to one dataset from [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php).
The task is to analyze the data and produce a report with following structure:

`5pts` 1) Introduction, problem description (regression/classification/clustering/etc.), target variable and features explanation

`10pts` 2) Cleaning and preprocessing data - removing or imputing missing data, standarization, one-hot encoding, handling outliers, etc.

`10pts` 3) EDA with focus on exploring relations between features nad target variable

`5pts` 4) Creating models, hyperparameter tuning

`10pts` 5) Graphical and descriptive model assessment

`10pts` 6) Summary, discussion on encountered problems and their solution e.g. how overfitting was avoided or imbalanced data mitigated

Code and descriptions/comments should be in Jupyter or R Markdown notebook. Both groups (104 and 105) are allowed to choose either R or Python (also remember there is Jupyter kernel for R). Please send reports to _lukasz.krainski123@gmail.com_ with following naming convention <index_number>_SLM_S1920_Report.< extension > before **03.06.2020r. EOD**. 
  
Each email should have 2 attachments: 
- for Jupyter: `.ipynb` file and `.html/.pdf` file generated from notebook, 
- for R Markdown:  `.Rmd` file and `.html/.pdf` file generated from notebook.

Below table of randomly picked datasets. If someone is missing on the list please contact me. If there is more than one dataset under given hyperlink, pick one.
